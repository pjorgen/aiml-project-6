## Overview
This project provides a data set of gene expressions and a separate set of labels. The purpose is to consume the data and
train a variety of ML models using a series of methods to see how they compare.

## Observations
This project was pretty straightforward. The primary learnings I got out of it were using the different methods to train
the models and some of the advantages and disadvantages of each method.
